You may find the project on the following url :

https://github.com/yassinumer/eiin839/tree/main/project/let's%20go%20biking

Steps to launching the project :

1. Lauch the executable in : "WebProxyService\HostedWebProxyService\bin\Debug\HostedWebProxyService.exe" ;
2. Lauch the executable in : "RoutingWithBikes\HostedRoutingWithBikes\bin\Debug\HostedRoutingWithBikes.exe" ;
3. The light client is accessible in : "LightClient\index.html" 
   Open the file in a browser and you should be able to get the itinirary from an address A to an address B.
   You just need to specify the fields (the departure and arrival addresses) and press on the "Find itinirary" button.
   For example in the departure input you can type in "Cours de la Gare, 94400 Vitry-sur-Seine" and "25 rue robert latouche" in the arrival.
4. The heavy client is similar to the light one. You need to specify the same fields. The only difference is that it displays direction steps inside of the console instead of displaying the map with an itinirary.

NB : The consoles of the self hosted applications display the URLs you must use the overall project.
